# Kidney Stone Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains the code for detecting kidney stones in medical images using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The project leverages deep learning techniques to train and evaluate the model on a dataset of kidney stone images.

## Project Overview

Kidney stones are a common medical condition, and early detection can help in timely treatment. In this project, we use the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect kidney stones in medical images efficiently. The implementation is done in Python using popular libraries like `ultralytics` for YOLO, `matplotlib`, and `OpenCV`.

## Features
- Download and use a kidney stone image dataset from Kaggle.
- Train and evaluate the YOLOv8 model on the dataset.
- Visualize results using heatmaps, bounding boxes, and other techniques.
- A streamlined pipeline to detect kidney stones with high accuracy.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- YOLOv8 via the `ultralytics` package
- Other Python libraries: `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `opencv-python`, `seaborn`, `squarify`, and `kaggle`

You can install the necessary packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
pip install squarify
pip install matplotlib opencv-python seaborn pandas kaggle
```

## Dataset

The project uses the [Kidney Stone Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/safurahajiheidari/kidney-stone-images), which can be downloaded using Kaggle's API. Ensure you have your Kaggle API credentials set up. The dataset will be automatically downloaded when you run the notebook.

To set up Kaggle API:
1. Go to your Kaggle account and download your `kaggle.json` file.
2. Upload the file to the notebook and move it to the correct directory.

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

# Move the file to where Kaggle expects it
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle/ && mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/ && chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

Download the dataset:
```bash
!kaggle datasets download -d safurahajiheidari/kidney-stone-images
```

## Usage

After setting up the environment and dataset, you can run the code cells in the notebook to:
1. Load the YOLOv8 model.
2. Train the model on kidney stone images.
3. Visualize the results using bounding boxes and class heatmaps.

### Loading YOLOv8
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Load pre-trained YOLOv8 model
```

### Training the Model
You can fine-tune the YOLOv8 model on the kidney stone dataset:
```python
model.train(data='path_to_dataset.yaml', epochs=50)
```

### Detection and Visualization
Run detection on the test dataset and visualize the results:
```python
results = model.predict(source='path_to_test_images/', save=True, conf=0.5)
```

### Visualization
Use `matplotlib` and `opencv` to visualize the predicted bounding boxes and compare ground truth vs. predictions.

## Results

The model can detect kidney stones with a high degree of accuracy, visualizing the bounding boxes on the detected stones in the images.
